//Pseudocode

//Start
//Initialize array ‘grades’ to size [10]
//For i from 0 to 9:
    //While True: loop until valid float is entered:
    //Prompt user for grade + (i + 1)
    //Get user input, Vvlidate input to ensure a floating-point number
    //Store in grades [i]
//Else: Output “Invalid input. Enter a Valid Decimal value”
	  //Discard the invalid input

//Initialize sum to 0
//For each grade in grades:
     //sum = sum + grade average

//average = sum / 10

//initialize max to grades [0]
//initialize min to grades [0]	
//for I from 1 to 9:
    //if grades [i] > max: max = grades [i]
    //if grades[i] < min: min = grades [i]
//Output “Average: ” average + format to 2 decimal
//Output “Maximum: ” max + format to 2 decimal
//Output “Minimum: ” min + format to 2 decimal
//end
